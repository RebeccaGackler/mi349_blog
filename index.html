            Since I mentioned it in my first post, I’m going to delve more into the game <em>Be Washington</em>. For those of you who did not read my first post, <em>Be Washington</em> is a video game commissioned by Mount Vernon, the house where George Washington resided. In this game, the player chooses between several scenarios in George Washington’s career and gets to hear from various advisors to Washington before making a choice. Then, the player gets to see if their choice matches what Washington chose to do in real life. The game is narrated by Chris Jackson, the first actor to play Washington in the hit Broadway musical <em>Hamilton</em>.

            I first played the game while Michigan was in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, Mount Vernon was hosting free live events virtually. On one day, they hosted a massive round of <em>Be Washington</em>, encouraging viewers to play along. Due to technical difficulties, the viewers were not able to play along, so the woman hosting the event played a single-player mode and encouraged viewers to make suggestions as she played. The game was very engaging. It was a derivation of the interactive movie genre, since players watch footage of actors and scenes and then get to make decisions to drive the plot forward. It is an interesting way to learn about viewpoints of the day and personalize the study of history.

        <h2>Overlapping Fields: An Introduction</h2>

            Double majoring in media and history has given me the chance to explore the intersection of these studies. Understanding both has been crucial to shaping my worldview. In my experience while getting my undergrad degree, I have seen that studying one often involves an understanding of the other. To understand where we are in media today, we must understand where we’ve been. Also, media can be the best window into history.
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext">
            I think the relationship between the two is often overlooked, but I am excited to see changes in this. Museums and historical sites continually add various media features, such as corresponding documentaries and immersive websites. Mount Vernon has even created a simple video game on their website entitled <em>Be Washington</em>, in which players are placed in a given situation in Washington’s career and can sort through the information available to him in order to determine what decision they would have made in his shoes. I think this is a wonderful learning tool and should inspire other historical organizations to create similar experiences for their patrons.
        </p>
        <p class="blogtext">
            I hope to use this blog to explore the way media of all forms affects the field of history and vice versa. From learning tools to historical fiction to media of the past, we will journey into these overlapping fields.
